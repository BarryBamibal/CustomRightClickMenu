This extension does not store any personally identifiable information.
This extension uses your browser's  [browser.storage.sync](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync)
to sync your data across devices. This data only consists of 
your custom right-click menu and its settings.
This means that these settings are stored on your browser manufacturer's servers.
To turn off this feature, disable the "use storage sync" checkbox at the top of this page.
